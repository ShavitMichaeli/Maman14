# Maman 14 - Shavit Shabtay Michaeli , I.D. 205782659
# First, Since Python 3.7 Dictioneries are already sorted, in anyway, this code is should be sorted without the Python Hash tables sorting method.
# I've inserted in each of those algorithms counting which will count both *Comparisons* and *Assignments* any time that it be needed.
# Notice of the imports, The Jit is running on this file.
# Also notice that the Python system is avoiding from getting a big number of recursion steps. So I've changed it to allow us excecute this program.
# Thank You Very Much!!!

# is checking if the number itself is bigger than the number before him, if its not, the number is keep checking which number is smaller than him,
# if smaller number is found before the current number, the current number will be placed in the right postion just after the number which is smaller than him.
# if it not: the bigger number will remain in it's position on the array and the array continue to the next iteration.
