Hi all :)

This task made by the university for finding differences between algorithms complexity and finding differences between elements on given list.

In each iteration, the algorithm creates a list ,

I've made this task in Python for my convenient.

The university approved using an outsourced algorithem implementations, Which helped me implement the Random Quicksort Algorithm at question 3.

That's it for now. :)
